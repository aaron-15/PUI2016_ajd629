## ASSIGNMENT 1

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar, Achilles Saxby and Anastasia Shegay for this assignment. 
I used my code from the previous assignments, Vishwajeet helped me understand the histogram.
For the distribution and the test, I refered the internet. I attempted to use the KL method but could not understand how to read the output so I did the KS test for both the distribtions viz. Normal and logistic distribution.

## ASSIGNMENT 2

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar, Achilles Saxby and Anastasia Shegay for this assignment. 
I used the skeletion notebook as reference for this assignment. Vishwajeet helped me remove the Nan values and convert the values of the table into a numerical value. He also helped me plot the scatter matrix.
I fitted the lines by myself using references from the applied data science class and your code.
I have not changed the for loop which have been iterated in two different way, but I have surely understood the difference.
I understood the meaning of high leverage and high influence in statastics from Youtube.
I discussed many portions of the assignment with Achilles Saxby and Anastasia Shegay.

## ASSIGNMENT 3

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar, Achilles Saxby, Anastasia Shegay and Priyanshi Singh for this assignment. 
We came up with our own individual hypothesis and discussed it and recieved feedback from one another.
Below is the solution to the assignment 3.

1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Null Hypothesis: The percentage of fat loss by the people in test group who dieted is less than or equal to the percentage of fat loss by the people in the control group who did exercise
Alternative Hypothesis: The percentage of fat loss by the people in test group who dieted is more than the percentage of fat loss by the people in the control group who did exercise

Null Hypothesis: H0 = %(Fat loss)diet <= (Fat loss)exercise

Alternative Hypothesis: Ha = %(Fat loss)diet > (Fat loss_exercise

2. Do Americans trust the president

Null Hypothesis: The proportion of adult americans who find the President trustworthy is more than the proporton of adult americans who find the President untrustworthy.
Alternative Hypothesis: The proportion of adult americans who find the President trustworthy is less than or equal to the proportion of adult americans who find the President untrustworthy.

Null Hypothesis: P0 - P1 > 0

Alternative Hypothesis: P0 - P1 <= 0

3. Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.

Null Hypothesis: The cessation rates for smokers using the nicotine patches is less than or equal to the cessation rates for smokers using the placebo patch.

Alternative Hypothesis: The cessation rates for smokers using the nicotine patches is more than the cessation rates for the smokers using the placebo patch.

Null Hypothesis: H0 = (Cessation rate)nicotine <= (Cessation rate)placebo

Alternative Hypothesis: H0 = (Cessation rate)nicotine > (Cessation rate)placebo

4. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Null Hypothesis: IQ of children of the age group 1 - 4 of mother's who smoked during their pregnancy is higher than the IQ of other children of the same age group of mother's who did not smoke during their pregnancy.
Alternative Hypothesis: IQ of Children of the age group 1 - 4 of mother's who smoked during their pregnancy is lower than other children of the same age group of mother's who did not smoke during their pregnancy.

Null Hypothesis: Mean(IQ at different ages)smoked > Mean(IQ at different ages)not-smoked

Alternative Hypothesis: Mean(IQ at different ages)smoked <= Mean(IQ at different ages)not-smoked
