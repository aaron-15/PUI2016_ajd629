### Review

Unfortunately, since the data processing part of the file is not available in your repository, I cannot review the reproducabilty of your plot.

The plot is well constructed with all the necessary elements and a good background. But, I would recommended using another type of graph, perhaps a sparkline graph to plot your data. The information together is very difficult to interpret and compare, and i think sparkline graph might help with it.

Hope the review is beneficial.
