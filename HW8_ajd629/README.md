# Working with Data - Computer Lab for Guest Lecture Julia Lane

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar, Achilles Saxby, Priyanshi Singh, Akshay Pen and Nonie Mathur for this assignment.

I did the data wrangling by myself. I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar for the analysis. Priyanshi Singh helped me with the regular expressions.

I assisted the others in the data wrangling and plotting part.

# Plot review

I reviewed the plots of Alexey Kalinin and Xinshi Zheng.
