I found out the location of the needed output viz. latitude, longitude, current location of the bus and stop point name using the keys method.
Priyanshi Singh and Vishwajeet Shelar explained me the methods to write into a csv file viz. readlines and writerow method, and I wrote the file using the writerow method.
Priyanshi Singh also helped me understand my mistake in the for loop.

I found the csv file from the CUSP datahub facility. 
I completed most of the assignment myself refering pandas documentation and stackoverflow to check the syntax.
I verified my code with Achilles Saxby after producing the scatter plot.
