# Collaborators: I worked with Vishwajeet, Achilles Saxby, Priyanshi Singh, Anastasia Shegay and Akshay Penmatcha for this Homework.

## Assignment 1:

I cleaned the data and used references from the internet to work on this assignment.
Priyanshi Singh helped me with merging my data.
Vishwajeet Shelar helped me with the likelihood estimation.

## Assignment 2:

I did the ttest and calculated the effect size for this assignment.
Since the variance was not the same, I used the eq_var = False in the ttest function.
The value of effect size is very large on account of highly different variances.
