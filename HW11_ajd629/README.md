## Assignment 1

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar. I used his code to download the data. He also helped me with the plotting of the map, in particular providing suggestions to use alpha and linewidth command.

## Assignment 2

I worked with Vishwajeet Shelar, Priyanshi Singh and Achilles Saxby. I completed most of the sections by myself, taking help from Vishwajeet to plot the timeseries and for the inference of the data. I used the elbow method and the silhoette score to estimate the number of clusters (I know you had mentioned 'handful' of clusters, but since the method was showing 2 as the best clusters i went ahead with it. For the second clustering method, I chose DBSCAN and did the inference by myself for which I refered materials available on the internet. I helped Achilles Saxby and Priyanshi Singh in a few sections of the assignment.
