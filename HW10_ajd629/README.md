# Geo-Spatial Analysis

For this assignment I worked with Vishwajeet, Achilles, Priyanshi, Akshay. Vishwajeet helped me with the coding.  We discussed the meanings of the plots and maps together.

While interpreting the plot, I had a difficulty understanding the LISA method

* The citibike data provided by Kashuk is already cleaned and used by him in the lab, and the same data is required for the assignment, so I have used the same cleaned data.


* While plotting the time series for the output of "statsmodel.tsa.seasonal_decompose", the graph is being plotted in wrong dimensions, however on re-executing the cell, the graph is plotted correctly
