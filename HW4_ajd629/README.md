# Assignment 1

I cloned the repository of Xinge Zhong and read it completely.
It was a well witten hypothesis. I suggested the ANOVA test for the analysis.

# Assignment 2

I did this assignment with Vishwajeet Shelar and Akshay Pen

### Part - II (Choosing one from the Second Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved the Logistic Regression test. Here this uses archaeological data to relate the variable that is highly affected by the change in the Independent Variables.

# Assignment 3

I did the Z -test and the chisquare test with the assistance of Achilles Saxby, Vishwajeet Shelar, Priyanshi Singh and Anastasia Shegay.

I interpreted the data after understanding the test available online, I did not interpolate the data either test.

# Assignment 4

I did the KS test myself and I could not understand the Pearson's and Spearman's test.
Vishwajeet helped me execute the program, but I looked up on the internet to understand it.
