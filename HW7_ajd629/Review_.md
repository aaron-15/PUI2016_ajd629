#Boxplot of trip duration by gender REVIEW  

What I like about the plot is that is clean, with good axis labels and explaining title. Also, the comparison between males and females is straight forward. Nontheless, boxplot are figures hard to read, specially for those without some statistical background. Therefore, it would be useful to have a caption explaining the median and the meaning of the box and whiskers. Also, it would we interesting to know the median of each distribution , for a full set of describing measurements. Although, the boxplot method for pyplot is hard to customize.
